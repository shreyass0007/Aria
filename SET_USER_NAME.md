# Setting Your User Name

To personalize Aria with your name, add the following line to your `.env` file:

```
USER_NAME=Your Name Here
```

For example:
```
USER_NAME=Shreyas
```

If you don't set this value, Aria will default to calling you "User".

## Where This Appears

Your name will be used in:
- Time-based greetings ("Good morning, [Your Name]")
- Welcome messages ("Welcome back [Your Name]")
- About screen ("Developed with ❤️ by [Your Name]")
- Self-introduction ("I am Aria, created by [Your Name]")
