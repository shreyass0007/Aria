## 🎯 Basic Features - Your First Steps

### Tutorial 1: Your First Command

**Let's start simple:**

1. **Type in the input box**: `What time is it?`
2. **Press Enter** or click the send button
3. **Aria responds**: With the current time and speaks it aloud

**What just happened?**
- Aria processed your text command
- Checked the system time
- Responded in both text (UI) and voice (TTS)

### Tutorial 2: Wake Word Activation

**Try voice control:**

1. **Click the microphone icon** 🎙️ in the UI
2. **Say**: "Aria" (the wake word)
3. **Aria responds**: With a personalized greeting
4. **Now say a command**: "What's today's date?"

**Wake Word Tips:**
- Speak clearly in a quiet environment
- Wait for Aria's response before the next command
- You can change the wake word (see Customization section)

### Tutorial 3: Simple Conversations

**Aria can chat naturally:**

```
You: "Tell me a joke"
Aria: [Responds with a joke]

You: "Explain quantum computing in simple terms"
Aria: [Provides a clear explanation]

You: "Write a short poem about rain"
Aria: [Creates a poem]
```

**Pro Tip:** Aria remembers context within a conversation!

## 🎙️ Voice Control - Hands-Free Operation

### Understanding Voice Mode

Aria has **two voice modes**:

1. **Wake Word Mode** - Always listening for "Aria"
2. **Command Mode** - After wake word, listens for your command

### Voice Command Structure

**Pattern 1: Direct Commands**
```
"Aria, open Chrome"
"Aria, what's the weather?"
"Aria, set volume to 50"
```

**Pattern 2: Natural Language**
```
"Aria, can you tell me what time is it?"
"Aria, I need to schedule a meeting tomorrow at 3 PM"
"Aria, organize my downloads folder please"
```

### Voice Settings

**Adjusting Speech Recognition:**

The app auto-adjusts to ambient noise, but you can tweak:
- Speak 2-3 feet from the microphone
- Reduce background noise
- Speak at a normal pace (not too fast/slow)

**Text-to-Speech (TTS) Control:**

By default, Aria speaks all responses. To disable:
- This feature can be toggled in settings (future feature)

---

## 🖥️ Desktop Control

### Opening Applications

Aria can open any installed application on your Windows PC.

#### Tutorial 4: Launch Apps by Voice

**Basic Examples:**
```
"Aria, open Chrome"
"Aria, launch VS Code"
"Aria, open Calculator"
"Aria, start Spotify"
"Aria, open Notion"
```

**How it works:**
1. Aria indexes your Start Menu shortcuts
2. Uses fuzzy matching to find apps
3. Handles variations (e.g., "chrome" finds "Google Chrome")

**Smart Matching:**
```
❌ "open browser" - Too generic
✅ "open chrome" - Specific app name
✅ "open google chrome" - Full name works
✅ "open figma" - Partial match works
```

#### Tutorial 5: Opening Multiple Things

**Chain commands naturally:**
```
You: "Aria, open VS Code and Chrome"
Aria: [Opens VS Code first, then Chrome]
```

### What Apps Can Aria Open?

- **Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Brave
- **Development**: VS Code, PyCharm, Git, Terminal
- **Productivity**: Notion, Obsidian, Excel, Word
- **Communication**: Discord, Slack, Teams, Zoom
- **Media**: Spotify, VLC, Photos

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue 1: "Backend fails to start"

**Symptoms:** Electron shows "Connecting..." forever

**Solutions:**
```powershell
# 1. Check if Python backend is running
.venv\Scripts\activate
python backend_api.py

# 2. Verify .venv path in electron/main.js
# Make sure it matches your actual venv location

# 3. Check for port conflicts
# Backend runs on port 5000 by default
```

#### Issue 2: "Voice not working"

**Solutions:**
1. **Check microphone permissions:**
   - Windows Settings → Privacy → Microphone
   - Allow desktop apps to access microphone

2. **Test microphone:**
```python
python
>>> import speech_recognition as sr
>>> sr.Microphone.list_microphone_names()
# Should show your microphones
```

3. **Reduce background noise:**
   - Speak in a quieter environment
   - Adjust `energy_threshold` in aria_core.py (advanced)

4. **Install PyAudio properly:**
```powershell
pip install pipwin
pipwin install pyaudio
```

#### Issue 3: "No AI responses"

**Check:**
1. **.env file exists** with valid `OPEN_AI_API_KEY`
2. **Restart after adding .env**
3. **Test API key:**
```powershell
python verify_openai.py
```

#### Issue 4: "Calendar auth not working"

**Solutions:**
1. **Delete old token:**
```powershell
del token.pickle
```

2. **Verify credentials.json exists** in root folder
3. **Re-run Aria** → Browser opens for auth
4. **Grant permissions** in the browser window

#### Issue 5: "Notion integration not working"

**Check:**
1. **API key in .env:**
```env
NOTION_API_KEY=secret_...
```

2. **Pages shared with Aria integration:**
   - Open Notion page → "..." → "Add connections" → "Aria"

3. **Test connection:**
```powershell
python verify_notion.py
```

#### Issue 6: "App won't open [AppName]"

**Solutions:**
1. **Check exact app name:**
   - Open Start Menu and see the actual name
   - Use that name in command

2. **Try variations:**
```
"open vs code"
"open visual studio code"
"open code"
```

3. **Re-index apps:**
