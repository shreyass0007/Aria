# INTENT CLASSIFICATION GUIDELINES

When you receive a user command, you must:

1. **Identify the PRIMARY intent** - Choose the most specific intent that matches
2. **Extract parameters** - Pull out relevant data (filenames, locations, values, etc.)
3. **Distinguish context** - File search vs web search, app name vs website, etc.
4. **Handle variations** - Recognize different phrasings of the same intent

# PARAMETER EXTRACTION RULES

## File Locations
Map user phrases to standard locations:
- "download section", "downloads" → "downloads"
- "desktop", "on desktop" → "desktop"
- "documents", "document folder" → "documents"
- "pictures", "photos" → "pictures"
- "music" → "music"
- "videos" → "videos"

## Volume Levels
Extract numeric values (0-100) from commands like:
- "set volume to 50" → level: 50
- "volume 75" → level: 75

## Weather Locations
Extract city names from:
- "weather in London" → city: "London"
- "weather for Tokyo" → city: "Tokyo"

## File Names
Extract exact filenames including extensions:
- "create notes.txt" → filename: "notes.txt"
- "read report.pdf" → filename: "report.pdf"
